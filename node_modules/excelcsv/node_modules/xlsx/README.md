# xlsx

Currently a parser for XLSX/XLSM/XLSB files.  Cleanroom implementation from the
ISO 29500  Office Open XML specifications, [MS-XLSB], and related documents.

## Installation

In node:

    npm install xlsx

In the browser:

    <!-- JSZip must be included before xlsx.js -->
    <script lang="javascript" src="/path/to/jszip.js"></script>
    <script lang="javascript" src="/path/to/xlsx.js"></script>

## Usage

Simple usage (walks through every cell of every sheet and dumps the values):

    var XLSX = require('xlsx')
    var xlsx = XLSX.readFile('test.xlsx');
    var sheet_name_list = xlsx.SheetNames;
    xlsx.SheetNames.forEach(function(y) {
      for (z in xlsx.Sheets[y]) {
        if(z[0] === '!') continue;
        console.log(y + "!" + z + "=" + JSON.stringify(xlsx.Sheets[y][z].v));
      }
    });

The node version installs a binary `xlsx2csv` which can read XLSX/XLSM/XLSB files and output the contents in various formats.  The source is available at `xlsx2csv.njs` in the bin directory.

See <http://oss.sheetjs.com/js-xlsx/> for a browser example.

Note that older versions of IE does not support HTML5 File API, so the base64 mode is provided for testing.  On OSX you can get the base64 encoding by running:

    $ <target_file.xlsx base64 | pbcopy # the pbcopy puts the content in the clipboard

Some helper functions in `XLSX.utils` generate different views of the sheets:

- `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_csv` generates CSV
- `XLSX.utils.sheet_to_row_object_array` interprets sheets as tables with a header column and generates an array of objects
- `XLSX.utils.get_formulae` generates a list of formulae

For more details:

- `bin/xlsx2csv.njs` is a tool for node
- `index.html` is the live demo
- `bits/90_utils.js` contains the logic for generating CSV and JSON from sheets

## Cell Object Description

`.SheetNames` is an ordered list of the sheets in the workbook

`.Sheets[sheetname]` returns a data structure representing the sheet.  Each key
that does not start with `!` corresponds to a cell (using `A-1` notation).

`.Sheets[sheetname][address]` returns the specified cell:

- `.v` : the raw value of the cell
- `.w` : the formatted text of the cell (if applicable)
- `.t` : the type of the cell (constrained to the enumeration `ST_CellType` as documented in page 4215 of ISO/IEC 29500-1:2012(E) )
- `.f` : the formula of the cell (if applicable)
- `.r` : the rich text encoding of a cell text (if applicable)
- `.h` : an HTML rendering of the rich text (if applicable)
- `.c` : comments associated with the cell
- `.z` : the number format string associated with the cell (if requested)

For dates, `.v` holds the raw date code from the sheet and `.w` holds the text

## Options

The exported `read` and `readFile` functions accept an options argument:

| Option Name | Default | Description |
| :---------- | ------: | :---------- |
| cellFormula | true    | Save formulae to the .f field ** |
| cellHTML    | true    | Parse rich text and save HTML to the .h field |
| cellNF      | false   | Save number format string to the .z field |
| sheetStubs  | false   | Create cell objects for stub cells |
| sheetRows   | 0       | If >0, read the first `sheetRows` rows ** |
| bookDeps    | false   | If true, parse calculation chains |
| bookFiles   | false   | If true, add raw files to book object ** |
| bookProps   | false   | If true, only parse enough to get book metadata ** |
| bookSheets  | false   | If true, only parse enough to get the sheet names |
| bookVBA     | false   | If true, expose vbaProject.bin to `vbaraw` field ** |

- `cellFormula` only applies to constructing XLSB formulae.  XLSX/XLSM formulae
  are stored in plaintext, but XLSB formulae are stored in a binary format.
- Even if `cellNF` is false, formatted text (.w) will be generated
- In some cases, sheets may be parsed even if `bookSheets` is false.
- `bookSheets` and `bookProps` combine to give both sets of information
- `Deps` will be an empty object if `bookDeps` is falsy
- `bookFiles` adds a `keys` array (paths in the ZIP) and a `files` hash (whose
  keys are paths and values are objects representing the files)
- `sheetRows-1` rows will be generated when looking at the JSON object output
  (since the header row is counted as a row when parsing the data)
- `bookVBA` merely exposes the raw vba object.  It does not parse the data.

The defaults are enumerated in bits/84_defaults.js

## Tested Environments

 - Node 0.8.14, 0.10.1
 - IE 6/7/8/9/10 using Base64 mode (IE10/11 using HTML5 mode)
 - FF 18 using Base64 or HTML5 mode
 - Chrome 24 using Base64 or HTML5 mode

Tests utilize the mocha testing framework.  Travis-CI and Sauce Labs links:

 - <https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/js-xlsx> for XLSX module in node
 - <https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/SheetJS.github.io> for XLS* modules
 - <https://saucelabs.com/u/sheetjs> for XLS* modules using Sauce Labs

## Test Files

Test files are housed in [another repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/test_files).

## Testing

`make test` will run the node-based tests.  To run the in-browser tests, clone
[the oss.sheetjs.com repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/SheetJS.github.io) and
replace the xlsx.js file (then fire up the browser and go to `stress.html`):

```
$ cp xlsx.js ../SheetJS.github.io
$ cd ../SheetJS.github.io
$ simplehttpserver # or "python -mSimpleHTTPServer" or "serve"
$ open -a Chromium.app http://localhost:8000/stress.html
```
