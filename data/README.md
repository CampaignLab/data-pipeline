## Data documentation
Raw data is what we mainly worked on during the day - does *not* include the large 2018 results dataset posted on the main issues page.

Some cleaned data was posted to Slack in #general.

The 2014 to 2018 lookup table is in the raw form available from the ONS. It's a many-to-many correspondence - we haven't cleaned this up to recommend a one-to-one linkage or some sort of weighted linkage.
